# No_Thanks

"No Thanks" is a deck-building card game with the goal of obtaining the lowest final score. The 2-3 player game is played with cards numbered 3 through 35, of which 9 are discarded at random, leaving 24 cards. 

Each player begins the game with 0 cards and 11 tokens. At the beginning of a turn, a card is drawn from the shuffled deck. A player may either take the card or pass by placing one of her tokens into the token pot. If a player is out of tokens, she must take the card. When a player takes a card, another is immediately drawn and the same player may choose to take the new card or pass by playing a token. The next player gets a chance to take/pass on the card only after the previous player has passed. When the card is taken, the player takes all tokens in the token pot along with it. The game ends when the last card from the deck is taken.

A player's final score is calculated by adding the points of the cards in her hand and subtracting the number of tokens in her possession. A card's number gives its point value, except in the case where a player has collected a run of consecutively-numbered cards. The point value of an entire run is equal to the value of the lowest-numbered card in that run. For example, a player with the hand

[3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 15]

has a score of 3 + 10 + 15 = 28, from which the number of the player's tokens is then subtracted.
